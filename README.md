# N-Queens Problem Solver

## Purpose of the Project

This project aims to provide a solution to the N-Queens problem using backtracking.

## Introduction

The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem that involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Solving with Backtracking

Backtracking is a common approach to solve the N-Queens problem. The algorithm explores possible placements of queens on the chessboard, backtracking when it determines that the current placement cannot lead to a solution.

The backtracking algorithm systematically explores the search space, trying out different configurations until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
